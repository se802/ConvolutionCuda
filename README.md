# Speeding up Convolution Algorithm with CUDA

Convolution is a fundamental operation in many signal and image processing applications. The convolution algorithm can be computationally expensive, especially for large input sizes. One way to speed up the convolution algorithm is to use CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA.

This project demonstrates how to implement the convolution algorithm using CUDA, resulting in significant performance improvements.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- A CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU
- The CUDA toolkit and driver installed on your system
- A C compiler that supports CUDA (e.g., NVCC)

## Installation

To install the project, simply clone the repository:


## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Compile the project using NVCC.
2. Run the executable with the input parameters.
3. Compare the performance of the CUDA implementation with the baseline implementation.

## Results

Our experiments show that the CUDA implementation of the convolution algorithm can achieve significant speedups compared to the baseline implementation. For example, on a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1060, we observed a speedup of up to 35x for large input sizes.


## Conclusion

In this project, we have demonstrated how to implement the convolution algorithm using CUDA to achieve significant performance improvements. We hope that this project will be useful to researchers and practitioners in the signal and image processing communities.
